Here are the key requirements for a **User Management System** from a customer's perspective, focusing on **CRUD operations** and **role-based permissions**:

---

### **1. User CRUD Operations**  
#### **A. Create (Add) User**  
- Ability to register/add new users with details:  
  - Username (unique)  
  - Email (unique)  
  - Password (encrypted)  
  - First & Last Name  
  - Phone Number (optional)  
- Admin should be able to manually add users.  
- Users may self-register (if enabled).  

#### **B. Read (View) Users**  
- Admins can view **all users** in a list/grid.  
- Search & filter users by:  
  - Name, Email, Role, Status (Active/Inactive).  
- Pagination support for large datasets.  

#### **C. Update (Modify) User**  
- Admins can edit:  
  - User details (name, email, phone).  
  - Reset passwords.  
  - Assign/change roles (e.g., `ROLE_USER` â†’ `ROLE_ADMIN`).  
- Users can edit their own profiles (but not roles).  

#### **D. Delete (Remove) User**  
- Admins can **soft-delete** (disable) or **hard-delete** users.  
- Option to deactivate instead of delete (for audit trails).  
- Deletion confirmation prompt.  

---

### **2. Role-Based Permissions**  
- **Predefined Roles**:  
  - `ROLE_USER`: Basic access (view own profile, edit personal info).  
  - `ROLE_ADMIN**: Full access (CRUD all users, assign roles).  
- **Rules**:  
  - Admins can assign/revoke roles.  
  - A user cannot self-promote/demote.  
  - At least one `ROLE_ADMIN` must always exist.  

---

### **3. Security & Validation**  
- Password policies (min length, complexity).  
- Email verification for new registrations.  
- Audit logs for user actions (e.g., role changes, deletions).  
- Rate limiting for login attempts.  

---

### **4. Additional Features (Nice-to-Have)**  
- Bulk import/export users (CSV/Excel).  
- Temporary admin access (time-bound permissions).  
- API support for integration with other systems.  

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**  
- Responsive UI (works on desktop/mobile).  
- Database backups for user data.  
- GDPR compliance (data deletion requests).
